# Baselinka

Chrome extension that shows the baseline of DOM elements on hover.

## How it works 

Baselinka tries to put a dummy element alongside the target node, then extracts the dummy's vertical position. It calculates whether the element is in a flex container or an inline.

## Controls

`Alt + MouseWheel` - show the baseline of a parent elements.
